This is the repository for my course project for Getting and Cleaning
Data from Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The exercise consists of the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

In the repository you will find the files:

-   `run\_analisys.R` is the R code to create the tidy dataset
-   `tidy.txt` is the output dataset
-   `CodeBook.md` is a file containing the description of the variables
